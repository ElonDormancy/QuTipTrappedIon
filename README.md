# QuTip Homework
Repository to store the HM of qutip(https://github.com/qutip)
## HM 1
Rabi oscillation
- Use Qutip to calculate the Rabi oscillation under a perfect drive, plot the
following graphs (with the correct labels): 1. population evolution with time; 2.
Fixed time, population vs. scanning frequency; 3. Evolution on the Bloch sphere.
- Suppose we have 20% and 50% amplitude error, respectively, re-plot the
evolution on the Bloch sphere

## HM 2
- Plot the spin evolution under a perfect Ramsey experiment
- Suppose during the free evolution, we have random phase shifts that varies from
shot to shot, but is fixed in a single experiment (for example caused by slowly
changing magnetic field for a Zeeman sensitive qubit). Take a uniform
distribution between [0, Ï€/6] and average over 100 shots, how much does the
Ramsey contrast decay?
- Numerically simulate how spin echo can remove this (although very ideal)
perturbation. Show it on the Bloch sphere.

## HM 3
Composite pulse sequence vs. Counter diabetic driving
- Take an SK1 pulse sequence for example, and we want to flip the qubit from up
to down. Calculate the qubit evolution with SK1 sequence and CD drive (e.g.
Alberly-Elden scheme mentioned in our journal club), plot them on the bloch
sphere.
- Suppose we have 20% and 50% amplitude error, respectively, re-plot the
evolution on the Bloch sphere.
